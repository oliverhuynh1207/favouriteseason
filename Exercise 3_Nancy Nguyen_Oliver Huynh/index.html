			<h2>Exercise 3.</h2>

		<div id="thoughts" class="content">
			<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>
				We teamed up in two for this exercise, and we totally agree that it's better to have someone to struggle together. There are two outcomes in total for this exercise under the theme 'Weather': one test sample of two basic sunny and rainy weathers, other is our final version of all-year-round seasons.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="issues" class="content">
			<h3>Issues</h3>
			<p>
				We struggled for a while with animation effect like rain splash or snowflake drop. When we tried to upgrade the first sketch to advanced version with more detailed illustration and interactive display, we also faced some hinder like to keep the rain and snow animation concurrently active with screens switch function.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="achievements" class="content">
			<h3>Achievements</h3>
			<p>
				Our very first test sample was very simple, basically just to switch screen mode from rainy to sunny weather with mouse press function. But in the end we managed to deliver a four seasons outcome with key events function we learned from in-class exercise, which is both fun to play with and aesthetically-pleasing to look at.

		<div id="testing" class="content">
			<h3>Testing</h3>
			<p>
				We had another group test out first sample, they thought that it was lacking both in term of visuals or interaction and suggested us experiment with more type of weather. Therefore, we created a four-piece set of more detailed full-screen illustrations and applied key event function as to switch between multiple screen displays.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="feedback" class="content">
			<h3>Feedback</h3>
			<p>
				Some feedbacks from other groups complimented our group sketch's visuals and color scheme, other feedbacks said that they wanted to see more motion effect in each 'season' mode. However, in our opinion the illustrations were already complex, adding more animation effect would be overloaded for the sketch; so we decided to keep the final outcome just as decent.
